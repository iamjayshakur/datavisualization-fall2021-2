# Assignment 6: Design a visualization

Using the same data from [assignment5](assignment5.md), create a data visualization using DataWrapper. As in assignment5, it should be an appropriate visualization type for the data. It should also have all necessary components (hed, chatter, source, etc.)

Export an image of the visualization and upload it to github, titled `assignment6.md`.
