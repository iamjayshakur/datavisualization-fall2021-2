# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

First, read the [Quartz Guide to Bad Data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide)

1. Find a "large" dataset (6+ columns, 100+ rows) that would require cleaning before you can analyze it. This should be related to your final story idea, even if you don't end up using it in your final project.
2. Save an original copy of the data as a `.csv` file
3. Use the techniques you learned in class (and the power of Google) to clean the data, while documenting _each_ action you take. 
4. Save the cleaned data as a second `.csv` file.

In your github repo, turn in `assignment3.md` with your documentation, as well as the original and cleaned CSVs. Include markdown links to your files using this format `[link text](filename.csv)`
